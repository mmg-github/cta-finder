# CTA FINDER TOOL

The Call-to-Action (CTA) Finder Tool is a web-based, interactive application which produces a list of appropriate calls-to-action (e.g., Bit.ly/Vanity links and QR codes) that help partners promote the All of Us Research Program to their specific audiences in accordance with their market and/or activity type. The CTA Finder Tool should be used when developing audience-specific materials for most, if not all, activities.
